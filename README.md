# StockApp
Source code for StockApp, based on final project for Java Development Certification.

## Setup
Please run PopulateTablesWithData before running SimpleStocksUi to ensure
the tables are created and contain the correct field names.

The Resources folder contains a sample stock_info.xml file to use to test
option 4 - uploading an XML file to the local db.
