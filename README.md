# StockApp
Source code for StockApp, based on final project for Java Development Certification.
A video demonstration can be viewed on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/R-iqtq5pAsw).

## Setup
Please run PopulateTablesWithData before running SimpleStocksUi to ensure
the tables are created and contain the correct field names.

The resources folder contains a sample stock_info.xml file which can be used to test
option 4 - uploading an XML file to the local db.

## Limitations
Free version of Unibit API limits number of data points that can be accessed each month.
